# binance_robot
My attempt to create a robot for cryptocurrency trading. The idea is to use several indicators for the machine decision on buying and selling. On short term, the goal is to set a few indicators and simulate trading without money. On medium term, develop strategies and trade with money on computer based platform. On a far future, develop a bunch of indicators that interact with each other and dock the bot in a cloud service to run 24/7.

## Pre-steps:

- Set PYTHONPATH to the current repository directory
- Use `setup/environment_setup.yml` to create conda environment with respective dependecies
